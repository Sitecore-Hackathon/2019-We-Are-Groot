**Category:** Sitecore SXA Module

Module Purpose: The API connector module in SXA is a module designed for the convenience of the Marketers or the developers to fetch the values securely from the client server, filter out the relevant data using and use the data effectively for other operations to just show the data in page, use computation methods to manipulate the data or just to check out what data is coming from the API. This might also be used in the Data exchange framework to fetch the data and store it as Sitecore items.

How Does the end user use the Module: The targeted audience for the module become the Marketers and the non Sitecore developers who struggle day in day out to understand what data the Client API fetches and to effectively filter out the data using the input parameters? They can now connect to the API connector module in SXA provide the URL, provide the header parameters if required and view the data in JSON format. They can also filter out the data by providing specific and relevant input parameters to the APIâ€™s.
